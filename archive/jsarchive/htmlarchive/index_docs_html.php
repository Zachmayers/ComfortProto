<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>C.Your California  Privacy Rights</b>
<p>A  California resident who has provided personal information to a business with  whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or  household purposes (&ldquo;California customer&rdquo;) is entitled to request information  about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third  parties for the third parties&rsquo; direct marketing purposes. In general, if the  business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a  request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of  all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding  calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that  were disclosed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However,  under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists  if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a  policy of not disclosing customer&rsquo;s personal information to third parties for  their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees  to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy.  Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his  or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost  free means to exercise that right.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do  not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a  third party, including  employers, your information will be subject  to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want  that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third  party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information.  You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your  information to determine how that entity will handle your information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>California  customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by  e-mailing <a href="mailto:privacy@servebartendcook.com">privacy@servebartendcook.com</a>.  Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer  each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other  than through this e-mail address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not monitor, recognize or honor any opt-out or do not track mechanisms including general web browser, “Do Not Track” settings and/or signals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>D. No  Information Collected from Children.</b>
 <p>We will never knowingly collect any  personal information about children under the age of 18. If we obtain actual  knowledge that we have collected personal information about a child under the  age of 18, that information will be immediately deleted from our database.  Because it does not collect such information, we have no such information to use or to  disclose to third parties. We have  designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy  Protection Act (&quot;COPPA&quot;).</p>
